# ECG Feature Extractor
Wavelet-based ECG delineator and feature extractor library implemented in python. 

The library required to perform ECG delineation is provided, along with instructions of use, in WTdelineator.py. This implementation is based on the work: Mart√≠nez, Juan Pablo, et al. "A wavelet-based ECG delineator: evaluation on standard databases." IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering 51.4 (2004): 570-581.

Two examples are provided, one performs delineation on a single signal (delineateSignal.py) of the STAFFIII database (https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/staffiii/) and the other on the whole database (delineateDatabase.py). They both require the pyhon PhysioToolkit WFDB python package (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/wfdb-python). The second example requires the annotations.csv file, which is a summarised version of the annotations provided in the STAFFIII files.

All the functions contained in this repository were developed in the Multiscale Cardiovascular Engineering Group at University College London (MUSE-UCL) by Carlos Ledezma.
